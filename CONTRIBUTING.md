## How to contribute

Use pull requests to contribute to the project.

If the company is not in the list, then create a subsection for the company, then add that in the table of contents.

```
## Table of Contents
- [Generic Company Name BD](#generic-comapany-name-bd)
## Generic Company Name BD
```
Else list the interview question under that company section. If the question is already added in other company section but not under the company you are currently wanting to contribute then too you can add the question.

Stick to the following format to add a question under a company:
```html
<details>
<summary>
[Question]
</summary>
<br>
[Answer]
</b>
</details>
```
Example:
<details>

<summary>
What is 1+1?
</summary>
<br/>
1+1 equals 3
</br>
</details>



## Before submitting the pull request

Check if all the formatting is correct.
